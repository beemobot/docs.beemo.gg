# XP
Beemo's XP system allows for members to gain experience as they participate in the server.

## About

Users are able to gain XP through both text and voice channels, with customisable curves and rewards for levels. Servers can then add roles to be rewarded at different level milestones and benefit from an intregrated XP leaderboard.
